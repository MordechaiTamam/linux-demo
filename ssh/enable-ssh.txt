On the guest machine:
  sudo apt-get install openssh-server -y

On the VBox manager -> machine settings -> network -> advanced -> port forwarding

from the host machine (through a terminal client such as Mobaextrem):
  Generate SSH keys:
    Launch ssh-keygen (for the actual keys generation purpose)
    open /home/mobaxterm (Here you can find the keys that you just generated)
  ssh-copy-id -p 2245 ubuntu@localhost
  ssh ubuntu@127.0.0.1 -p 2245
